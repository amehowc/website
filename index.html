          Hi, im Arthur. I’m a brand strategist by day and I code web-based
          design tools when I’m not sleeping or playing with my cat. I’m not
          looking for work but I’m always interested in collaborating with cool
          people with larger than life ideas. My weapon of choice are
          javaScript, webCanvas and webGL but I’m always curious about learning
          new stuff and trying new technologies. I’m not the best at keeping my
          portfolio up to date but I’m trying to use this website to showcase
          what I like to do and maybe give some of you a taste of what’s
          possible in this new age of design. Shoot out to my amazing friends
          and clients. Feel free to reach out and say hi !

          Ps . Please understand that some of those are commissioned work and I
          won’t share the final product but either the proof of concept or
          underlining principles. Let me know if you do anything cool out of my
          shenanigans.

          Pps. I’m a self taught dev with no real computer science background
          and I’m not doing this full-time. It might happen that my code suck or
          is not really optimized. If you happen to improve anything i’ve done,
          open a branch in GitHub and I’ll gladly merge it :)
